"""Constants and helpers shared by the scripts of experiment 170 (best-guess stage 1 assembly).

The constants, periods, and run dates are experiment 111's, copied so this folder imports only
itself.
The stored fits, ensemble arrays, and feature cache are read from experiment 111's private data
folder; this experiment writes only under its own `WORK_DIR`.

**Three periods, each with one role.** The tuning period is the odd months of 2024-07 to 2025-06
(calibration, solar shrink, filter hyperparameters, spread factors, the XGBoost bars' start
choice), the replicate period is the even months of the same year (the sign of the contrasts), and
the scored year is 2025-07-01 to 2026-06-30 (the 292 runs of `fold_a_daily_gap_v1`). A run belongs
to the month of its `power_fcst_init_time`.
